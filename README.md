 Simple Neural network in Colab, which can become an integral part of the system of a bot for the game of "Tic-tac-toe". Using the prepared database of images, create and train a neural network that recognizes two categories of images: crosses and zeros

1)Dence.Preparation of the necessary libraries

2)Dataset for dense

3)Data preparation for dense network

4)Model dense.Ð¡reate a network model architecture.

5)One last thing... Press run and see the result of model training
